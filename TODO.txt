- rework and abstract stuff , make it more professional and readable
- generate the jar
- test with real cases
- create a draft for the visualizer
- create a config tab in which you can :
                                        - setup the links between localhost and regular urls
                                        - having another syntaxe than key=property
                                        - default directory path setup instead of loading it manually
                                        - later on , set the main microservices inn the visualizer to not overload or find good ui....
- adding a update button ?


-------------------
Bug reporting :
- when deleting an item in a list it will replace the item in the file by "" and it will just be an empty spot.. it messes up the list view
- when adding a new performance item after "all" it replaces the "all" item
