- Sort keys alphabetically ( ignore the #'s and sort them like if they weren't commented out)
- rework and abstract stuff , make it more professional and readable
- generate the jar
- First test with real cases
- create a draft for the visualizer
- create a config tab in which you can :
                                        - setup the links between localhost and regular urls
                                        - having another syntaxe than key=property
                                        - default directory path setup instead of loading it manually
                                        - later on , set the main microservices inn the visualizer to not overload or find good ui....
- adding a update button ?
